## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Multiple named resources share one install operation

The install command SHALL accept one or more resource names from configured registries or a single `--from` Git or directory source. All existing consumer roots and include trees required by the operation MUST satisfy `consumer-config-format` before acquisition or new writes; an absent target root retains its v4 creation behavior under `config-mutation`. Shared scope, resource kind, ref, and path options MUST apply to every requested name. The operation MUST resolve all requested selections before publishing configuration and acquisition lock changes, and MUST synchronize the batch once. Repeated names MUST be selected and reported once, in first-request order.

#### Scenario: Install several names from one explicit source

- **WHEN** a user installs several resource names with `--from`, `--scope`, `--kind`, `--ref`, and `--path`
- **THEN** every named resource MUST be selected from that source and path at the requested ref and materialized in the requested scope
- **AND** unrelated selections MUST remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Install several names from configured sources

- **WHEN** a user installs several resource names without `--from`
- **THEN** every name MUST resolve using the configured registries and existing kind-disambiguation and write-scope rules
- **AND** the complete batch MUST be selected and synchronized in one operation

#### Scenario: Repeated names are deduplicated

- **WHEN** a user repeats resource names in a named batch
- **THEN** each resource MUST be selected and reported once in first-request order
