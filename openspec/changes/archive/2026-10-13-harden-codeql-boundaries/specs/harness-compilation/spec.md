## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Integer metadata remains representable

Harness ingestion MUST reject integer metadata outside the supported native integer range and MUST reject non-finite or fractional values instead of wrapping or truncating them. Representable integral values MUST retain their exact value.

#### Scenario: Integer metadata does not wrap

- **WHEN** canonical, Factory, or Gemini subagent metadata supplies a nesting limit that is out of range, non-finite, or fractional
- **THEN** ingestion MUST reject the subagent rather than accepting a wrapped integer
- **AND** a representable integral nesting limit MUST retain its value
